Context and scientific objectives: SAT (decide if a Boolean formula, typically
in conjunctive normal form, admits a valuation which makes it true?) is a
fundamental problem in complexity theory with very large practical benefits.
Modern SAT solvers can now handle propositional satisfiability problems with
hundreds of thousands of variables or more. However, many practical instances
remain difficult to all the available SAT solvers. Consequently, new
approaches are clearly needed to solve these challenging industrial problems.
In this context and with the light of the next generation of computer
architectures, the design of parallel satisfiability solvers becomes a
fundamental issue. The aim of this PhD is to provide new theoretical and
practical advances for parallel satisfiability solving.
