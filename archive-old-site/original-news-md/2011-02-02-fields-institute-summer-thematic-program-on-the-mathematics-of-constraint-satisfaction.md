#### Overview:



During July and August 2011, the Fields Institute will host a thematic program
on the Mathematics of Constraint Satisfaction. The program will include a
5-day summer school, three focused workshops, the Coxeter Lectures, regular
weekly seminars, and extended periods of time for in-residence researchers and
students for intensive study. The program will bring together researchers from
various communities within pure mathematics and theoretical computer science.
