## Venue



To be held in Turunç (Turkey) from Monday 27 June to Friday 1 July 2011



Themes



The objective of this _advanced-level_ summer school is to study integration
opportunities between CP solvers and the solvers of some other constraint-
solving technologies, namely mixed integer programming (MIP), global
(numerical) optimisation, Boolean satisfiability (SAT), and stochastic local
search (SLS). Each speaker will focus on inference & relaxation, search,
modelling, and implementation.



## Lecturers
