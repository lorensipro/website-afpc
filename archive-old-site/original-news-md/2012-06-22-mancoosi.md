The Mancoosi International Solver Competition (MISC)  
<http://www.mancoosi.org/misc-2012/>  
Call for Participation  
  
  
IRILL, the the Center for Research and Innovation on Free Software,  
calls for the third international competition of solvers for  
package/component installation and upgrade problems. Instances of  
these problems are given by a set of currently installed or available  
software packages, with complex relations between them like  
dependencies, conflicts, and features. The problem instances used in  
the competition are expressed in a language called CUDF that allows to  
express relationships between components like they are known for  
instance in GNU/Linux distributions, or for Eclipse plugins. We are  
not only interested in finding some solution to such a problem, but in  
finding the best solution according to different optimization  
criteria. For a detailed description please look at the competition  
web page  
  
<http://www.mancoosi.org/misc-2012/>  
  
Participating solvers will be judged by the correctness of the  
solution, the quality of the solution according to the respective  
optimization criteria, and speed. The results of the competition will  
be announced on September, 8, at the LoCoCo workshop at ICLP 2012  
(<http://lococo.irill.org/2012>).
