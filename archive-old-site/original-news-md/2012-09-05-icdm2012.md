Call for Papers  
2012 Workshop on Declarative Data Mining  
December 10, 2012, Brussels, Belgium  
<http://liris.cnrs.fr/wdpm2012>  
  
Held in conjunction with ICDM 2012  
The 12th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining  
[http://icdm2012.ua.ac.be](http://icdm2012.ua.ac.be/)  
======================================================================  
  
State-of-the-art systems for data mining contain highly efficient  
algorithms, however, the tasks supported are often limited. More  
specifically, they often lack support for solving enumeration problems  
other than the pre-defined ones.  
Their main weakness is at the language level, making it hard or  
impossible to:  
* add (or remove) constraints, or,  
* support slight modifications of the problem statement.  
This lack of flexibility and genericity is problematic and limits the  
potential of existing data mining systems.  
  
An emerging research trend is the combination of declarative modeling  
languages with generic and efficient solving techniques. These  
"declarative pattern mining" approaches are often inspired by  
successful methodologies from other research fields, such as databases  
and A.I.  
  
This workshop aims to stimulate the cross-fertilization between data  
mining, artificial intelligence, combinatorial algorithmic and  
databases, to bring original solutions to fundamental data mining  
problems.  
  
The topics covered include (but are not limited to):  
* High-level declarative languages (logical or algebraic) for  
expressing pattern mining problems  
* Complexity results and algorithms for pattern enumeration problems  
* Constraint-based mining  
* Mining complex patterns using constraint (logic) programming,  
Satisfiability (modulo theory), Integer Linear programming, ...  
* Modeling complex pattern problems using itemsets  
* Classification of complex pattern mining problems  
* Use cases of complex pattern mining  
* Coupling database and pattern mining systems  
  
  
PAPER SUBMISSION  
  
All submissions will be handled electronically via CyberChair. Paper  
submissions should be from 6 to 8 pages long in the IEEE 2-column  
format. All papers will be reviewed by the program committee on the  
basis of technical quality, relevance to the workshop topics,  
originality, significance, and clarity. Papers that do not comply with  
the Submission Guidelines will be rejected without review.
