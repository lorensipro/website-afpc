Workshop on Optimization for Smart Cities and related applications  
  
To be held in conjunction with the 18th International Conference on Principles
and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2012) Quebec City, Canada  
  
Municipal leaders who run the complex network of diverse people, expected
services and aging infrastructure are on a constant search for more efficient
ways to analyze data, anticipate problems and coordinate resources in their
cities.  
Developing methods for fulfilling such a need involves, among other things,
data analytics and intelligent sensor dissemination, modeling human demands
and operations and planning, often under uncertainty.  
  
This workshop has the purpose of bringing together scholars and practitioners
that work on the solution of problems related to the improvement of the
quality of life and the use of resources in cities, to make cities smarter.  
  
This workshop is organized within the CP2012 conference, and one invited talk
will be delivered by  
  
Lisa Amini, Lab Director, IBM Research -- Ireland Smarter Cities Technology
Centre  
  
We invite submissions of a short abstract (not more than 4000 characters)
describing original work on applications of methods, with special emphasis on
optimization, for "making our cities smarter".  
Techniques and applications of interest include (but are not limited to):  
  
\- Constraint Programming  
\- Mathematical Programming  
\- Hybrid algorithms  
\- Interconnection between Simulation and Optimization;  
\- Intelligent transportation systems  
\- Electric mobility  
\- Smart grids  
\- Waste management  
\- Urban planning  
\- Natural resources management  
\- Data analytics  
\- Modeling human demands  
\- ...  
  
The submissions will be evaluated by the program committee and a selection of
abstracts will be admitted for presentation at the workshop. We encourage the
submission of new challenging problems, including data instances.  
Note that registration at the CP2012 conference is necessary to attend and
present at the workshop.  
  
Abstracts can be submitted by email to Andrea Lodi at
