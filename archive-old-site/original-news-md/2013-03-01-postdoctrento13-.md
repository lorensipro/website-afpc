Doctoral Student Positions in Information and Communication Technologies  
on the research project  
  
"Advanced SMT Techniques for Word-level Formal Verification - (WOLF)"  
  
are available at the International Doctorate School in Information and  
Communication Technologies (<http://www.ict.unitn.it/>) of the  
University of Trento, Italy, under the joint supervision of  
\- Alessandro Cimatti, FBK, Trento, and  
\- Roberto Sebastiani, DISI, University of Trento.  
  
The research activity will be carried out jointly within the Embedded  
Systems (ES) Research Unit of the Center for Scientific and  
Technological Research of the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), Trento,  
and the Software Engineering & Formal Methods (SE&FM) Research  
Program, at Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science  
(DISI) of University of Trento.  
  
The research activity will aim at investigating and developing novel  
techniques, methodologies and support tools for Satisfiability Modulo  
Theories (SMT) for the formal verification of systems. This work will  
be part of the "Advanced SMT Techniques for Word-level Formal  
Verification - (WOLF)" project, a three-year research project  
supported by SRC/GRC (<http://www.src.org/compete/s201113/>), in strict  
collaboration with the Formal Verification Group at Intel, Haifa, and  
other major HW companies.  
  
The goal of the WOLF project is to provide a comprehensive SMT package  
to support effective formal verification of systems ranging from RTL  
circuits all the way up to high-level hardware description languages  
(e.g. SystemC) and software. The package will be implemented on top of  
the MathSAT.5 SMT platform (<http://mathsat.fbk.eu/>), and provided as an  
API.  
  
Ph.D. courses will start in Autumn 2013, and the thesis must be  
completed in three or four years. People enrolled Ph.D. courses are  
expected to move to Trento, and will receive monetary support during  
phases of their activity.  
  
Candidate Profile  
=================  
  
The ideal candidate should have an MS or equivalent degree in computer  
science, mathematics or electronic engineering, and combine solid  
theoretical background and excellent software development skills  
(in particular C/C++).  
  
The candidate should be able to work in a collaborative environment,  
with a strong commitment to reaching research excellence and achieving  
assigned objectives.  
  
Background knowledge and/or previous experience in the following areas  
(in order of preference), though not mandatory, will be considered  
very favorably:  
\- Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT)  
\- Propositional Satisfiability (SAT)  
\- Model Checking  
\- Automated Reasoning  
\- Constraint Solving and Optimization  
\- Embedded Systems Design Languages (e.g. Verilog, VHDL)  
  
Applications and Inquiries

Interested candidates should inquire for further information and/or  
apply by sending email to [wolf-recruit@disi.unitn.it](mailto:wolf-
recruit@disi.unitn.it)  
  
Applications should contain a statement of interest, with a Curriculum  
Vitae, and three reference persons. PDF format is strongly encouraged.  
  
Emails will be automatically processed and should have  
  
'PHD ON WOLF PROJECT'  
  
as subject.

The Embedded Systems Research Unit at FBK  
=========================================  
  
The Embedded Systems Unit consists of about 15 persons, including  
researchers, post-Doc, Ph.D. students, and programmers. The  
Unit carries out research, tool development and technology transfer in  
the fields of design and verification of embedded systems.  
  
Current research directions include:  
  
* Satisfiability Modulo Theory, and its application to the  
verification of hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid  
systems (Verilog, SystemC, C/C++, StateFlow/Simulink).  
  
* Formal Requirements Analysis based on techniques for temporal logics  
(consistency checking, vacuity detection, input determinism,  
cause-effect analysis, realizability and synthesis).  
  
* Formal Safety Analysis, based on the integration of traditional  
techniques (e.g. Fault-tree analysis, FMEA) with symbolic  
verification techniques.  
  
The Embedded Systems Unit is part of Fondazione Bruno Kessler,  
formerly Istituto Trentino di Cultura, a public research institute of  
the Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy), founded in 1976. The  
institute, through its center for the scientific and technological  
research, is active in the areas of Information Technology,  
Microsystems, and Physical Chemistry of Surfaces and  
Interfaces. Today, FBK is an internationally recognized research  
institute, collaborating with industries, universities, and public and  
private laboratories in Italy and abroad. The institute's applied and  
basic research activities aim at resolving real-world problems, driven  
by the need for technological innovation in society and industry.  
  
The SW Engineering & Formal Methods Research Program at DISI  
============================================================  
  
The SW Engineering & Formal Methods R. P. at DISI currently  
consists on 5 faculties, various post-docs and PhD students. The  
Unit carries out research, tool development and technology transfer in  
the fields of Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering, Agent-oriented  
SW engineering, Security, and Formal Methods.  
  
Referring to formal methods, current research directions include:  
  
* Satisfiability Modulo Theory, and its application to the  
verification of hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid  
systems.  
  
* Advanced Model Checking Techniques for Formal Verification of  
hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid systems.  
  
* Applications of Propositional Satisfiability (SAT) to various  
domains.  
  
The R.P. is part of the Department of Information Engineering and  
Computer Science, DISI (<http://disi.unitn.it/>) of University of Trento.  
University of Trento in the latest years has always been rated among the  
top-three small&medium-size universities in Italy.  
DISI currently consists of 50 faculties, 68 research staff and support  
people, 21 postdocs and 146 Doctoral students, plus administrative and  
technical staff. DISI covers all the different areas of information  
technology (computer science, telecommunications, and electronics)  
and their applications. These disciplines above are studied  
individually but also with a strong focus on their integration,  
  
Location  
========  
  
Trento is a lively town of about 100.000 inhabitants, located 130 km  
south of the border between Italy and Austria. It is well known for  
the beauty of its mountains and lakes, and it offers the possibility  
to practice a wide range of sports. Trento enjoys a rich cultural and  
historical heritage, and it is the ideal starting point for day trips  
to famous towns such as Venice or Verona, as well as to enjoy great  
naturalistic journeys. Detailed information about Trento and its  
region can be found at <http://www.trentino.to/home/index.html?_lang=en>.
