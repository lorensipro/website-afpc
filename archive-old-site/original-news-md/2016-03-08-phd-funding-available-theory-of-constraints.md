Funded PhD Studentships, Department of Computer Science, Royal Holloway,  
University of London, UK.  
  
Applications are invited for funded PhD studentships in the Department  
of Computer Science at Royal Holloway, starting on 19th of September  
2016\. We particularly welcome female applicants as they are  
under-represented among our PhD student population.  
  
The constraints group is particularly interested in application sin one  
of the following areas:  
*) how the constraint representation affects tractability.  
*) Any aspect of valued constraints.  
*) Hybrid classes that are tractable (neither language, nor structure)  
*) forbidden patterns or minor patterns that allow tractability or  
variable/value elimination.  
*) A proper description of the current state of tractability, by  
describing the classes of global relations, rather than abstruse algebra.  
*) The workflow scheduling problem: aka a characterisation of fixed  
parameter tractable conservative languages.  
  
but any good constraints theory topic, or application of algorithms to  
real world problems would be great.  
  
These studentships are for three years and include a stipend of circa  
£16,000 per year plus a Home/EU fee waiver. Applicants are expected to  
have obtained a first-class degree in Computer Science or a cognate  
discipline, and must obtain the support of a potential supervisor in the  
Department prior to submitting an applications. Initial contact with  
supervisors should be made at least two weeks prior to the closing date  
for applications.  
  
Closing date for open topic applications: 10th of April 2016.  
  
To apply, please use our on-line system  
  
<https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/studyhere/researchdegrees/applying/home.aspx>  
  
to submit the following items:  
  
(1) appropriate research topic/area;  
  
(2) a covering letter describing your reasons for wishing to pursue a  
PhD in the proposed area, incuding why you think that you are qualified  
to do research in that area;  
  
(3) a research proposal where you expand on your research topic: why the  
topic is important, what is the state of the art in the area, and what  
are the research contributions that you would like to make beyond the  
state of the art – this does not need to be too long but it should  
contain enough information for us to make a judgement on the viability  
of carrying out such a research project in the Department;  
  
(4) a current CV;  
  
(5) any documents proving your actual or expected degree  
classifications, as well as results of any previous University  
examinations;  
  
(6) two academic references.

The Department is one of the UK's leading centres for research into  
Computer Science. In the most recent Research Excellent Framework (REF  
2014), we rank 11th in the UK for the quality of our research output. We  
offer a very vibrant research culture that includes interdisciplinary  
links with several other departments. Our research is strongly supported  
by external funding from various sources, including companies.  
  
Royal Holloway was ranked 129th in the world and 19th overall in the UK  
in the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2015/16.  
We are situated in a beautiful campus in Egham, Surrey, ranked alongside  
Oxford and Cambridge as one of the twelve most beautiful universities in  
the world. We are both close to Central London and 10 minutes by taxi  
from Heathrow Airport.
