Co-located with 22th International Conference on Principles  
and Practice of Constraint Programming

Technical Description  
\---------------------  
During the last years, Biology has become a source of challenging  
problems for the entire field of Computer Science in general, and for  
the areas of computational logic and constraint programming in  
particular. Successful approaches to these problems are likely to have  
significant applications in several fields of research, such as  
medicine, agriculture, industry, etc. Several successful applications  
of the Logic and Constraint Programming paradigms in Bioinformatics  
have been carried out in the last years, in the area of phylogenetic  
tree reconstruction, in haplotype inference, in proteins structure  
prediction, in RNA secondary structure prediction, and in system  
biology, just to cite a few. The workshop aims at exchanging ideas  
between researchers and collecting, if possible, new problems to be  
faced in the next future by our community.  
  
Workshop Format  
\---------------  
WCB'16 is the 12-th of a series of consecutive Workshops on  
Constraint-Based Methods for Bioinformatics. Previous editions of WCB  
were co-located with various important international conferences, as  
reported below:

\- WCB'06: co-located with CP 2006 in Nantes  
\- WCB'07: co-located with ICLP 2007 in Porto  
\- WCB'08: co-located with CPAIOR 2008 in Paris  
\- WCB'09: co-located with CP 2009 in Lisbon  
\- WCB'10: co-located with FLOC 2010 in Edinburgh  
\- WCB'11: co-located with CP 2011 in Perugia  
\- WCB'12: co-located with ICLP 2012 in Budapest  
\- WCB'13: co-located with CP 2013 in Uppsala  
\- WCB'14: co-located with CP 2014 in Lyon

Paper Submission  
\----------------  
The topic of interest are all those concerning bioinformatics and  
constraints and related (SAT/ASP/Logic Programming/ILP) techniques,  
such as:  
\- RNA prediction and motif search  
\- protein structure and functional prediction  
\- genetic linkage analysis and haplotype inference  
\- pedigree reconstruction and diagnosis  
\- genomic selection design  
\- gene regulatory network inference and analysis  
\- biochemical network simulation and visualization  
\- solvers for problems in biology  
\- metabolic pathway analysis  
\- DNA sequence assembly  
\- contig scaffolding  
\- multiple sequence alignment  
\- machine learning and big data  
\- ontologies  
\- constraint biological databases  
\- logical interfaces to relational biological databases  
\- web bioinformatics services  
  
Submitted papers can be:  
\- Extended Abstracts concerning original (unpublished) results.  
\- Abstracts describing ongoing work.  
\- System descriptions (with demos at the workshop).  
\- Summaries of already accepted or recently published papers/results.  
\- Well-motivated proposals of bioinformatics problems for constraint  
based methods.  
  
Submitted papers should be 3-15 page papers in LNCS format. For each  
contribution we plan to have (at least) 3 reviews.  
  
Authors of accepted papers must provide camera-ready versions in PDF  
format. Furthermore, at least one author of each accepted paper must  
attend the conference to present the contribution. All WCB'16  
participants have to register for the CP 2016 workshop/conference.  
  
Submissions are managed through EasyChair
