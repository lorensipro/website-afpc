Twenty years ago the paper “[In Pursuit of the Holy
Grail](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1009749006768?LI=true)”
proposed that Constraint Programming was well-positioned to pursue the Holy
Grail of computer science: the user simply states the problem and the computer
solves it. This workshop will look at progress towards that goal, specifically
regarding work on automating:





  * Problem Acquisition: learning from examples, model reformulation, etc.


  * Solver Construction: tuning parameters, selecting from portfolios, etc.


  * User Explanation: reasons for failure, implications of choices, etc.




The increasing interest in Human-Aware AI and intelligent software assistants
make this a particularly timely topic.



This is a joint workshop of [CP2017](http://cp2017.a4cp.org/),
[ICLP2017](http://iclp17.a4lp.org/) and [SAT2017](http://sat2017.gitlab.io/).
