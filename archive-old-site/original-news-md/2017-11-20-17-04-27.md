[Twenty-Fourth Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint
Programming](http://cp2018.a4cp.org/) will take place in Lille, France, 27-31
August 2018.



<span style="font-family: " New="New" Roman",="Roman"," serif;"="serif;"">The
CP conference series concerns all aspects of computing with constraints,
including: theory, algorithms, environments, languages, models, systems, and
applications.



<span style="font-family: " New="New" Roman",="Roman"," serif;"="serif;"">The
CP 201<span style="font-family: " New="New" Roman",="Roman","
serif;"="serif;"">8<span style="font-family: " New="New" Roman",="Roman","
serif;"="serif;""> programme will include presentations of high-quality
scientific papers and tutorials on both theory and applications. Invited talks
will describe important topics relevant to the field. There are also workshops
and a doctoral program for students.

normally relate to CP technology, but submissions that deal with constraint
solving and are of potential interest to the CP community are also invited.
The thematic tracks, in particular, are intended to reach out to researchers
beyond the CP community. Each track has a dedicated chair and subcommittee to
ensure that reviewers have the relevant domain expertise.
