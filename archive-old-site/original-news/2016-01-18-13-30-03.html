<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;">The International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming will take place in Toulouse, France, from September 5th - 9th 2016.<br /><br />This is the 22nd edition of the annual conference on all aspects of computing with constraints, including: theory, algorithms, environments, languages, models, systems, and applications such as decision making, resource allocation, scheduling, configuration, and planning.<br /><br />The CP 2016 programme will include presentations of high quality scientific research papers and applications of constraints technology. A number of invited talks will also be presented that will describe important topics relevant to the field. As well as the usual workshop, tutorial and doctoral programmes, we will repeat the Journal-first and Sister Conference Track in which important results that have recently appeared in journals or sister conferences will be presented, the journal publication fast track for outstanding submissions, and the industry outreach programme.<br /><br />To encourage authors and delegate to participate, the CP 2016 conference will features new tracks in addition to the technical track and the application track. Each track has a specific sub-committee to make sure that competent reviewers will review the papers submitted by people of these domains. We introduce also to this conference a challenge based on a realistic industrial grade optimization problem.<br /><br />Full details at <a href="http://cp2016.a4cp.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">http://cp2016.a4cp.org</a></div>\r\n<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;"></div>\r\n<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px; line-height: normal;">---<br />Louis-Martin Rousseau Ph.D. <br />Professeur titulaire - Mathématiques et Génie Industriel<br />Professor - Mathematic and Industrial Engineering<br />CIRRELT - École Polytechnique de Montréal</div>
