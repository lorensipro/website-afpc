We hope you can participate in this conference by submitting a paper reflecting your current research in any of the following areas:\r\n - Methodologies and Technologies\r\n - Applications\r\n \r\nThe conference will be sponsored by the Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communication (INSTICC) and technically co-sponsored by the Associa??o Portuguesa de Investiga??o Operacional (APDIO). INSTICC is Member of the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC). Logistics Partner the Science and Technology Events (SCITEVENTS). \r\n \r\nThe purpose of the International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems (ICORES) is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in both advances and applications in the field of operations research. Two simultaneous tracks will be held, covering on one side domain independent methodologies and technologies and on the other side practical work developed in specific application areas.\r\n \r\nWe would like to highlight the presence of the following keynote speakers:\r\n - Sue Merchant, Blue Link Consulting, United Kingdom\r\n - Alexandre Dolgui, Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne, France\r\n - Karla Hoffman, George Mason University, United States\r\n \r\nICORES is interested in promoting high quality research as it can be confirmed by last year acceptance rates, where from 89 submissions, 20% were presented as full papers.\r\n \r\nSubmitted papers will be subject to a double-blind review process. All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on CD-ROM support.\r\nIt is planned to publish a short list of revised and extended versions of presented papers with Springer in a CCIS Series book (final approval pending).\r\nThe proceedings will be submitted for indexation by Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (ISI), INSPEC, DBLP, EI (Elsevier Index) and Scopus.\r\nAll papers presented at the conference venue will be available at the SCITEPRESS Digital Library (http://www.scitepress.org/DigitalLibrary/). SCITEPRESS is a member of CrossRef (http://www.crossref.org/).\r\n \r\nBest paper awards will be distributed during the conference closing session. Please check the website for further information (http://www.icores.org/BestPaperAward.aspx).\r\n \r\nWorkshops, Special sessions, Tutorials as well as Demonstrations dedicated to other technical/scientific topics are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in holding a tutorial are invited to contact the conference secretariat. Workshop chairs and Special Session chairs will benefit from logistics support and other types of support, including secretariat and financial support, to facilitate the development of a valid idea.\r\n \r\nICORES 2016 will be held in conjunction with  ICAART 2016 (International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence - http://www.icaart.org/) and ICPRAM 2016 (International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods - http://www.icpram.org/) in Rome, Italy. Registration to ICORES will enable free attendance to any sessions of ICAART and ICPRAM conferences as a non-speaker.\r\n \r\nPlease check further details at the ICORES conference website (http://www.icores.org/). \r\nShould you have any question please don't hesitate contacting me.\r\n \r\n \r\nKind regards,\r\nLucia Gomes   \r\nICORES Secretariat\r\n \r\nAv.
