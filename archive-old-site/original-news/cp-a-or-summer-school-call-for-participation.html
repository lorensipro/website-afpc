<p>Â </p>\r\n<div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-unicode">Dear colleagues,<br /> <br /> Let us introduce the <strong>Joint ACP and GdR RO Summer School 2017</strong>.     <br /> It will be held September, 18-22th, 2017 in Porquerolles island,     France.<br /> <br /> <a href="http://school.a4cp.org/summer2017">http://school.a4cp.org/summer2017</a><br /> <br /> This summer school is co-organized by the ACP and the French     constraint programming working group for "Constraints and     Operational Research" within the CNRS research group "Operational     Research".<br /> <br /> The topic of the school is "<strong>Hybridization of Constraint       Programming and Operational Research: from practical opportunities       to concrete implementation of solutions</strong>".<br /> <br /> During this week, participants will be raised awareness on several     classical and novel challenges at the frontier between Constraint     Programming and Operational Research. This year a focus will be done     on the tools that allow to provide concrete implementation of     solutions. Particularly, the participants will be challenged on a     given problem both in terms of modeling and implementation of a     solution in their own standalone tool. <br /> <br /> The school is intended for PhD students, masters students and     industrial practitioners, who want to get a good understanding of     capabilities and current research directions in the area of     Constraint Programming, particularly at the frontier with     Operational Research. Prior knowledge of Constraint Programming is     not required, but general problem solving skills, good programming     and mathematical skills will be helpful.<br /> <br /> Any questions? <br /> Email organizers at <a href="mailto:acpss2017@i3s.unice.fr">acpss2017@i3s.unice.fr</a></div>
