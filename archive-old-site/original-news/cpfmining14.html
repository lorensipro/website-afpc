At the same time, one continuously gathers vast amounts of data about these problems. This summer school starts from the observation that current software typically does not exploit such data to update schedules, resources and plans and aims at introducing a new approach in which gathered data is analysed systematically in order to dynamically revise and adapt constraints and optimization criteria. Ultimately, this could create a new ICT paradigm, called Inductive Constraint Programming, that bridges the gap between the areas of data mining and machine learning on the one hand, and constraint programming and optimization on the other hand. If successful, this would change the face of data mining as well as constraint programming technology. It would not only allow one to use data\r\n  mining t\r\nechniques in constraint programming to improve the formulation and solution of constraint satisfaction problems, but also to employ declarative constraint programming principles in data mining and machine learning.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne remarkable example is society, where human activities mediated by ICT generates big data in the form\r\nof digital traces that cannot only be used to evaluate the performance of the underlying\r\nconstraint satisfaction and optimization models but also to automatically revise and improve\r\nthe underlying models so that the solutions are automatically adapted to the behavior\r\nof the people. As one example, consider a public transportation schedule that continuously \r\nadapts itself to the real mobility patterns of people represented by the digital traces of individual travels. \r\nThus  the knowledge  mined in (big) data can help to adapt schedules, resources and plans to\r\nthe real dynamics in the real world.\r\n\r\nSo far, constraint solving has evolved quite independently from machine learning and \r\ndata mining. There has recently been a growing interest in the integration of these two \r\nfields, which can work in two ways: (a) constraint solvers can be included in machine \r\nlearning and data mining algorithms; and (b) machine learning and data mining can help \r\nin addressing and formulating constraint problems. Promising initial results have been achieved in both directions, \r\nin the ICON project and beyond and further research is ongoing to  establish a full integration.\r\n\r\nThe summer school "Constraint Programming meets Data Mining", organized by the FP7-ICT \r\nFET Open project ICON “Inductive Constraint Programming” (<a href="http://www.icon-fet.eu/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.icon-fet.eu</a>) provides \r\nan intensive training opportunity to learn the essentials of recent research on constraint \r\nsolving, machine learning and data mining, and the key aspects related to their integration.\r\n\r\nStudents will follow lectures from top experts of the fields, and will receive personalized \r\ntraining on selected exercises in hands-on labs.\r\n\r\n- Christian Bessiere, CNRS, University of Montpellier - France\r\n- Ian Davidson, University of California, Davis, US\r\n- Luc De Raedt,  KU Leuven - Belgium\r\n- Tias Guns, KU Leuven - Belgium\r\n- Lars Kotthoff, University College Cork -  Ireland\r\n- Yuri Malitsky, University College Cork -  Ireland\r\n- Mirco Nanni, ISTI-CNR, Pisa - Italy \r\n- Siegfried Nijssen, KU Leuven and University of Leiden - Belgium / The Netherlands\r\n- Dino Pedreschi, University of Pisa - Italy\r\n- Salvatore Ruggieri, University of Pisa - Italy\r\n- Helmut Simonis, University College Cork - Ireland\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Important Dates ***\r\nDeadline for application: May 20, 2014\r\nNotification: May 30, 2014\r\nSummer school starts: September 1st, 2014\r\nSummer school ends: September 5, 2014\r\n\r\n*** Venue ***\r\nThe venue for this event is Sampieri, an old fishing village, perhaps the most picturesque in the province of Ragusa, Sicily, Italy. This village is characterized by stone houses and very small streets in old stones.\r\n\r\nThe Summer school is held at the Marsa Siclà Residence in Sampieri, which is composed by 82 apartments and by the Club House including bar, restaurant/pizzeria, and other collective services.\r\nResidence facilities include: swimming-pool, volley court and a tennis court, soccer court, ping-pong table, etc.\r\n\r\nFor more details see <a href="http://www.marsasicla.it/en/" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">http://www.marsasicla.it/en/</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are looking forward to your participation!\r\n\r\n*** School committees ***\r\n\r\nSteering Committee\r\n\r\nChristian Bessiere, CNRS, University of Montpellier - France\r\nRemi Coletta, University of Montpellier - Frances\r\nLuc De Raedt, KU Leuven - Belgium (Co-Program Chair)\r\nSiegfried Nijssen, KU Leuven and University of Leiden - Belgium/The Netherlands\r\nBarry O'Sullivan, University College Cork - Ireland\r\nDino Pedreschi, University of Pisa - Italy (Co-Program Chair)\r\nHelmut Simonis, University College Cork - Ireland\r\nFranco Turini, University of Pisa - Italy \r\nSalvatore Ruggieri, University of Pisa - Italy \r\n\r\nOrganizing Committee\r\n\r\nAnna Monreale, University of Pisa - Italy\r\nValerio Grossi, University of Pisa - Italy\r\nMirco Nanni, ISTI-CNR, Pisa - Italy\r\n</pre>\r\n<div></div>
