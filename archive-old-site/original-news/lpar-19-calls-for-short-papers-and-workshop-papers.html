The 19th LPAR<br /> will be held in Stellenbosch, South Africa.<br /> <br /> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> * SHORT PAPERS<br /> <br /> In keeping with the tradition of LPAR, researchers and practitioners are<br /> invited to submit short papers reporting on interesting work in progress or<br /> providing system descriptions. They need not be original. Extended or revised<br /> versions of the short papers may be submitted concurrently with or after LPAR<br /> to another conference or a journal. Short papers are limited in length to 8<br /> pages in the EasyChair format.<br /> <br /> Accepted papers will be published electronically as a volume in the EPiC<br /> series, see <a href="http://www.easychair.org/publications/?page=38379010" target="_blank">http://www.easychair.org/publications/?page=38379010</a>.
