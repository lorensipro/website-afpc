<p>PhD scholarship on Constraints, Graphical Models and Algorithms</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Title: New Decompositions to Solve Graphical Models</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Laboratory: Laboratoire des Sciences de l'Information et des Systèmes (LSIS) – UMR CNRS 7296</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Advisors: Philippe Jégou, Cyril Terrioux</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>The topic of this research project is at the border of Mathematics and Computer Science. Although located in</p>\r\n<p>the domain of the foundations of constraint programming, this subject is based on the fundamental problem</p>\r\n<p>of graph (and hypergraph) decomposition (Robertson & Seymour 1986) (Gottlob et al 2000) (Jégou &</p>\r\n<p>Terrioux 2003). It is well known that constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), also called constraint</p>\r\n<p>networks, or more generally, Graphical Models (Dechter 2013, Koller & Friedman 2009) are represented by</p>\r\n<p>graphs or hypergraphs. While solving Graphical Models is a NP-hard task, when the structure of the</p>\r\n<p>networks representing the problem has some nice topological properties, it can be solved efficiently using</p>\r\n<p>decomposition (Jégou & Terrioux 2016). In summary, the subject proposed here focuses on the</p>\r\n<p>improvement of techniques for solving constraint satisfaction problems using decomposition. The integration</p>\r\n<p>of such a technique induces practical problems, but also more fundamental questions related to the concept</p>\r\n<p>of decomposition of graphs (or hypergraphs). Indeed, last years, several new mathematical tools have been</p>\r\n<p>developed by theorists. One may cite, by their associated graph parameters, branch-width (Seymour &</p>\r\n<p>Thomas 1994), clique-width (Courcelle & Olariu 2000), rank-width (Oum 2005), boolean-width (Bui-Xuan</p>\r\n<p>et al. 2011), matching-width (Jeong et al 2015), modular-width (Gajarsky et al. 2013), treecut-width (Wollan</p>\r\n<p>2015), or tree-depth (Nesetril & Ossona de Mendez, 2012), just to name a few. Unfortunately, there is a real</p>\r\n<p>gap between such works, and their application to practical and efficient methods to solve Graphical Models.</p>\r\n<p>One of the ambition of this line of research is to reduce this gap. The Ph.D. student based at LSIS will work</p>\r\n<p>on the theoretical and practical aspects of new decompositions. We have seen the difficulties that may arise</p>\r\n<p>passing from a graph decomposition, first introduced on a purely theoretical level, to the development of</p>\r\n<p>solving methods efficient in practice. The design, the theoretical study, the implementation (even based on</p>\r\n<p>toulbar2), experiments and improvements of this type of method is a work both difficult and substantial</p>\r\n<p>which requires considerable time on the one hand, and a mastering of the whole context, from theoretical</p>\r\n<p>foundations to experimental aspects.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Location: University of Aix-Marseille, Faculty of Sciences, LSIS, Marseille</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>These works are developed in the frame of the DEMOGRAPH programme, which is funded by the French</p>\r\n<p>National Research Agency and associates three laboratories namely the Université de Montpellier - LIRMM -</p>\r\n<p>UMR CNRS (Christophe Paul, Ignasi Sau, Dimitrios Thilikos, Christian Bessière, and Mamadou Kanté), the</p>\r\n<p>UR875 INRA Toulouse (Thomas Schiex, Simon de Givry, George Katsirelos and David Allouche and the</p>\r\n<p>LSIS (Marseille).
