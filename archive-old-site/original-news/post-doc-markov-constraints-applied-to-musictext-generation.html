These technologies are the key for developing a novel  generation of authoring tools in which users navigate in large  combinatorial spaces with high-level, meaningful controls. The project  includes the development of such prototype applications, and the study  of their impact on real-world creation tasks in music and literature.  Although very ambitious and challenging, the team has already produced  proof-of-concepts and core technologies and demonstrations (see  publications and references).</span></div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div><strong>Research topic</strong>: The project focuses on the notion  of “style” for temporal sequences, such as melodies or literary texts.  The goal is to develop style-centered content generation applications  that boost the creativity of the users. The key idea is to combine  statistical representations of style, such as Markov processes, with  constraints that represent structural properties of the generated  sequences. Our team has introduced a new theoretical framework, Markov  Constraints, which consists in reformulating Markov processes as  finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems. The subject of this  position is to extend Markov constraints to capture long-range stylistic  and structural aspects of sequences and to develop efficient algorithms  to solve the resulting generation problems. The application context  will be music and text generation.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div><strong>References:</strong></div>\r\n<div>P. Roy, F.
