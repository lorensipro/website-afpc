<p>A 14-month post-doctoral position is open for studying computational<br /> methods for chemogenomics.<br /> The position will be held jointly at the GREYC laboratory of the<br /> University of Caen (CNRS UMR 6072, France) and the Department of<br /> Computer Science of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium).<br /> <br /> Working context:<br /> The position is jointly funded by the Région Basse-Normandie and by the<br /> European Research Council (MiGraNT project).<br /> The position is included in our larger activity on designing efficient<br /> SAR methodologies.<br /> <br /> Locations:<br /> - Caen, Normandy, France<br /> - Heverlee, Vlaams-Brabant, Belgium<br /> <br /> Topic:<br /> In chemoinformatics, a SAR model aims at estimating the activity of a<br /> chemical (e.g. its toxicity or activity as candidate drug) from its<br /> structure.<br /> However, there exist other important factors, such as drug-drug<br /> interactions, protein-drug interactions, gene regulation and properties<br /> of the molecule other than its 2D structure such as its 3D structure and<br /> adme properties.<br /> <br /> The work will involve a better modelling of these effects, e.g. by the<br /> use of spatial data mining and network analysis methods.<br /> The developed models will be validated in collaboration with molecular<br /> biology and chemogenomics experts from both working locations, a.o. in<br /> protein families such as serotonines and kinases.<br /> The work will therefore be interdisciplinary, integrating topics from<br /> chemo-informatics, chemogenomics and computer science.<br /> <br /> Profile:<br /> We are looking for a PhD computer scientist with strong knowledge in at<br /> least one the following fields: combinatorial algorithms, data mining or<br /> computational geometry.<br /> Besides a sound experience of programming will be appreciated.<br /> <br /> Place, duration and remuneration:<br /> - 14 months contract, starting from early 2011.<br /> - net salary: between 1800 and 2000 Euros per month<br /> <br /> How to apply:<br /> <br /> Please send your application (PDF format) as soon as possible.<br /> Screening of applications starts immediately and continues until the<br /> position is filled.<br /> <br /> Send cover letter including names of at least two references, CV and<br /> PDFs of PhD dissertation (or draft) and up to three most relevant<br /> publications to the following emails:<br /> Bertrand Cuissart +33 2 31 56 73 72 <a href="mailto:Bertrand.Cuissart@info.unicaen.fr">Bertrand.Cuissart@info.unicaen.fr</a><br /> Bruno Crémilleux +33 2 31 56 74 35 <a href="mailto:Bruno.Cremilleux@info.unicaen.fr">Bruno.Cremilleux@info.unicaen.fr</a><br /> Jan Ramon +32 16 32 7739 <a href="mailto:Jan.Ramon@cs.kuleuven.be">Jan.Ramon@cs.kuleuven.be</a></p>
