<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px; line-height: normal;">Post-doc positions at<br />Microsoft-INRIA Joint Lab., <br />Saclay, France<br />Sept. 2011 - Aug. 2013<br />==========================<br />Two 24-months post-doctoral positions concerned with the application of Machine Learning methods to Search and Optimization are opened. The positions will be held at the Microsoft-INRIA joint laboratory at Saclay, (20km south of Paris), France.<br /><br />Topic:<br />=====<br />The context of the work is to learn efficient solving strategies on top of existing Constraint-based or Meta-heuristics optimization algorithms.<br /><br />A key challenge today for Constraint solvers is to be able to reformulate an existing CSP efficiently until the problem becomes obviously solvable or unsolvable. One possible topic of the post-doc will be to turn the reformulation of a given CSP into a reinforcement learning problem: define the state and actions spaces, and investigate the feasibility of learning a good reformulation strategy.<br /><br />Another possible research direction is to identify the context of competence of specific heuristics within the search, and to use the gained knowledge to define heuristics selection strategies. <br /><br />Profile:<br />=====<br />We are looking for PhD computer scientists with strong knowledge in at least one the following fields: Machine Learning and Data Mining (Reinforcement Learning, Monte-Carlo Tree Search, ...), Constraint Solving (exact and stochastic Optimization, Meta-Heuristics, ...). Strong programming skills are mandatory.  A sound experience of existing CSP solvers will be appreciated.<br /><br />Duration and remuneration:<br />====================<br />- 12+12 months contract, starting from September 2011.<br />- net salary: approx. 2100 Euros per month (health insurance included).<br /><br />Application:<br />=========<br />Please send your application (PDF format) as soon as possible.<br />Screening of applications starts immediately and continues until the position is filled.<br /><br />Send cover letter including names of at least two references, CV and links to PhD dissertation (or draft) and up to three most relevant publications to the following emails:<br />youssefh[at]microsoft[dot]com<br />marc[dot]schoenauer[at]inria[dot]fr<br />michele[dot]sebag[at]lri[dot]fr</span></p>
