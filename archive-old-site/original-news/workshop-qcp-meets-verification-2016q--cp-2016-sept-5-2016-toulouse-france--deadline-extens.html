The\r\nsuccess of CP comes from the fact that it provides high-level languages\r\nfor declaratively modelling a problem by means of constraints that\r\ncapture combinatorial substructures (and by means of an objective\r\nfunction) and for writing an efficient search procedure that solves the\r\nproblem. *Computer-aided program verification* has found widespread\r\napplications in both academia and industry in ensuring that systems are\r\ndependable and secure. The discipline is based on fundamental\r\nmathematical theories such as logic and automata, and covers algorithmic\r\ntechniques for formal analysis and synthesis, such as model checking,\r\nsatisfiability (SAT) solving, and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT).\r\nThese techniques have become essential tools for the design and analysis\r\nof hardware and software systems.\r\n\r\nThe "CP meets Verification" workshop gathers researchers and\r\npractitioners from constraint programming (CP), formal verification, and\r\nsoftware engineering, in order to address the *CP-based solving* of\r\nchallenging constraint problems in *formal verification* and *software\r\nengineering* and foster novel ideas between CP and formal verification,\r\nsince solvers of CP technology are orthogonal but complementary to\r\nsolvers of technologies like SAT, SAT modulo theories (SMT), integer\r\nprogramming (IP), and mixed integer programming (MIP).\r\n\r\nAs the workshop aims at fostering lively discussions and debates between\r\nparticipants, it will be organized around\r\n- several invited talks given by experts of the corresponding domains,\r\n- accepted talks based on a lightweight reviewing of submitted abstracts,\r\n- space for questions and discussions.\r\n\r\nThe CP meets Verification 2016 workshop invites all interested\r\nparticipants to *submit an abstract* of a talk to be presented during\r\nthe workshop. Talks may present both original or already published work,\r\ntool developments as well as work in progress. Talks with emphasis on\r\nnovel ideas or challenges are particularly welcome! Abstracts of at most\r\none page, in text or PDF form, should be submitted by Email by the\r\ndeadline given below. The talks most compliant with the workshop theme\r\nand objectives will be selected for presentation in a full-day workshop.\r\nFor all inquiries, please contact the organizers.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will not require paper submission and will not publish\r\nproceedings, but the presenters will be invited to submit the slides of\r\ntheir talks for publication on the workshop website.\r\n\r\nAll researchers and practitioners interested in the scope of the\r\nworkshop, whether presenters or not, are invited to attend the workshop\r\nand to participate in discussions.\r\n\r\nInquiries and submission of abstracts by Email: <a href="mailto:cpmeetsverif16@cea.fr" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">cpmeetsverif16@cea.fr</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n== Workshop Chairs ==\r\n\r\n- Sébastien Bardin (CEA LIST, France)\r\n- François Bobot (CEA LIST, France)\r\n- Nikolai Kosmatov (CEA LIST, France)\r\n\r\nContact: <a href="mailto:cpmeetsverif16@cea.fr" target="_blank" style="color: #1155cc;">cpmeetsverif16@cea.fr</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n== List of topics (not limited to) ==\r\n\r\n- CP-based verification\r\n- CP-based software engineering\r\n- challenges in formal verification where CP can be helpful\r\n- synergies between CP and verification technologies (model checking,\r\nabstract interpretation, etc.)\r\n- synergies between CP, SAT, SMT, IP and/or MIP</pre>
