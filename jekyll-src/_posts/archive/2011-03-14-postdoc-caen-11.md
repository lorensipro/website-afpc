A 14-month post-doctoral position is open for studying computational  
methods for chemogenomics.  
The position will be held jointly at the GREYC laboratory of the  
University of Caen (CNRS UMR 6072, France) and the Department of  
Computer Science of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium).  
  
Working context:  
The position is jointly funded by the Région Basse-Normandie and by the  
European Research Council (MiGraNT project).  
The position is included in our larger activity on designing efficient  
SAR methodologies.  
  
Locations:  
\- Caen, Normandy, France  
\- Heverlee, Vlaams-Brabant, Belgium  
  
Topic:  
In chemoinformatics, a SAR model aims at estimating the activity of a  
chemical (e.g. its toxicity or activity as candidate drug) from its  
structure.  
However, there exist other important factors, such as drug-drug  
interactions, protein-drug interactions, gene regulation and properties  
of the molecule other than its 2D structure such as its 3D structure and  
adme properties.  
  
The work will involve a better modelling of these effects, e.g. by the  
use of spatial data mining and network analysis methods.  
The developed models will be validated in collaboration with molecular  
biology and chemogenomics experts from both working locations, a.o. in  
protein families such as serotonines and kinases.  
The work will therefore be interdisciplinary, integrating topics from  
chemo-informatics, chemogenomics and computer science.  
  
Profile:  
We are looking for a PhD computer scientist with strong knowledge in at  
least one the following fields: combinatorial algorithms, data mining or  
computational geometry.  
Besides a sound experience of programming will be appreciated.  
  
Place, duration and remuneration:  
\- 14 months contract, starting from early 2011.  
\- net salary: between 1800 and 2000 Euros per month  
  
How to apply:  
  
Please send your application (PDF format) as soon as possible.  
Screening of applications starts immediately and continues until the  
position is filled.  
  
Send cover letter including names of at least two references, CV and  
PDFs of PhD dissertation (or draft) and up to three most relevant  
publications to the following emails:
