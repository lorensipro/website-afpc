"Tree-based Graph Partitioning Constraint" de Xavier Lorca  



Résumé : Combinatorial problems based on graph partitioning enable us to
mathematically represent and model many practical applications. Mission
planning and the routing problems occurring in logistics perfectly illustrate
two such examples. Nevertheless, these problems are not based on the same
partitioning pattern: generally, patterns like cycles, paths, or trees are
distinguished. Moreover, the practical applications are often not limited to
theoretical problems like the Hamiltonian path problem, or K-node disjoint
path problems. Indeed, they usually combine the graph partitioning problem
with several restrictions related to the topology of nodes and arcs. The
diversity of implied constraints in real-life applications is a practical
limit to the resolution of such problems by approaches considering the
partitioning problem independently from each additional restriction.  



This book focuses on constraint satisfaction problems related to tree
partitioning problems enriched by several additional constraints that restrict
the possible partitions topology. On the one hand, this title focuses on the
structural properties of tree partitioning constraints. On the other hand, it
is dedicated to the interactions between the tree partitioning problem and
classical restrictions (such as precedence relations or incomparability
relations between nodes) involved in practical applications.  



Precisely, Tree-based Graph Partitioning Constraint shows how to globally take
into account several restrictions within one single tree partitioning
constraint. Another interesting aspect of this book is related to the
implementation of such a constraint. In the context of graph-based global
constraints, the book illustrates how a fully dynamic management of data
structures makes the runtime of filtering algorithms independent of the graph
density.
