The successful candidate will carry out research in the field of  
programming systems, including but not limited to programming languages,

analysis and synthesis. Still, other areas of competence will also be  
considered, since qualifications take precedence over specialization.  
  
Responsibilities include research, supervision of undergraduate and

of research grants, and undergraduate/graduate teaching within the  
curricula in Computer Science ( <http://www.uclouvain.be/en-info.html> ).  
Courses are taught in French and English.  
  
ICTEAM currently hosts more than 40 professors and more than 200  
researchers. These researchers carry out both basic and applied research  
in key fields of information and communication technologies,  
electronics, computer science and applied mathematics. The University is  
located in the new city of Louvain-la-Neuve, 25 kms southeast of
