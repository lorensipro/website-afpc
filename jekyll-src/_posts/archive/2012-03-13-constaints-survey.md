Dear colleagues,  
  
I would like to remind you that the "Constraints" journal has created a  
"Survey" editorial line which welcomes survey/review papers. Survey  
paper are often highly cited and offer a rare opportunity to share your  
specific expertise.  
  
If you have accumulated a rare or extensive knowledge on a topic in the  
scope of the Constraints journal, spent time doing intensive  
bibliographic search on a hot topic, prepared an extensive tutorial or  
just finished an exceptional "State or the Art" chapter for your PhD  
thesis, please consider contacting me (the "Survey editor") with a  
Survey paper proposal.  
  
Curious about how a Survey paper looks ?  
See <http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10601-011-9115-6>
