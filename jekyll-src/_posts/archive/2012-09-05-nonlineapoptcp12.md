Workshop on Nonlinear Optimization in Constraint Programming  
  
To be held in conjunction with  
the 18th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint
Programming (CP 2012)  
Québec City, Canada  
  
<https://sites.google.com/site/minlpworkshop2012>  
  
This workshop has the purpose of bringing together scholars that work on
nonlinear optimization, in particular Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming
(MINLP) problems, which combine nonlinear constraints with integrality on one
or more variables. MINLP and Constraint Programming (CP) have a significant
overlap of techniques, ranging from domain reduction to implicit enumeration
techniques to heuristic algorithms for finding good feasible solutions.  
  
This workshop is organized within the CP2012 conference and aims at attracting
both CP and MINLP practitioners to discuss new developments. It is motivated
by recent exciting results in both disciplines.  
  
The organizing committee invites submissions of a short abstract (not more
than 4000 characters) describing original work on a problem or application of
MINLP, CP, or both, with a special emphasis on the nonlinear characteristics
of the problem. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):  
  
\- Domain reduction techniques in Global optimization;  
\- Quadratically constrained quadratic programming;  
\- Reformulations in MINLP solvers;  
\- Using CP methods in MINLP solvers;  
\- Software for MINLP and CP;  
\- Decomposition techniques for large scale MINLP and CP problems;  
\- Challenging real-world applications of MINLP and CP.  
  
The submissions will be evaluated by the program committee and a selection of
abstracts will be admitted for presentation at the workshop. We encourage the
submission of new challenging problems, especially those that are not
available in online libraries such as [minlp.org](http://minlp.org/),
GlobalLib, and MinlpLib. Note that registration at the CP2012 conference is
necessary to attend and present at the workshop.  
  
Abstracts can be submitted by email to Pietro Belotti at
