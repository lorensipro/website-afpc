One post-doc position in ICT on the research project  
  
"Advanced SMT Techniques for Word-level Formal Verification - (WOLF)"  
  
is available in Trento, Italy, under the joint supervision of  
\- Alessandro Cimatti, FBK, Trento, and  
\- Roberto Sebastiani, DISI, University of Trento.  
  
The research activity will be carried out jointly within the Embedded  
Systems (ES) Research Unit of the Center for Scientific and  
Technological Research of the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), Trento,  
and the Software Engineering, Formal Methods & Security Research  
Program, at Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science  
(DISI) of University of Trento.  
  
Aim and Scope  
=============  
  
The research activity will aim at investigating and developing novel  
techniques, methodologies and support tools for Satisfiability Modulo  
Theories (SMT) for the formal verification of systems. This work will  
be part of the "Advanced SMT Techniques for Word-level Formal  
Verification - (WOLF)" project, a three-year research project  
supported by SRC/GRC (<http://www.src.org/compete/s201113/>), in  
collaboration with major HW companies.  
  
The ultimate goal of the WOLF project is to provide a comprehensive  
SMT package to support effective formal verification of systems  
ranging from RTL circuits all the way up to high-level hardware  
description languages (e.g. SystemC) and software. The package will be  
implemented on top of the MathSAT SMT platform  
(<http://mathsat.fbk.eu/>), and provided as an API.  
  
Candidate Profile  
=================  
  
The ideal candidate should have an PhD in computer science or related  
discipline, and combine solid theoretical background and excellent  
software development skills (in particular C/C++).  
  
A solid background knowledge and/or previous experience on one of the  
following topics (in order of preference) is required:  
Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT), Propositional Satisfiability (SAT),  
Model Checking, Automated Reasoning.  
Previous experience in the following areas will also be considered  
favourably: Constraint Solving and Optimization, Embedded Systems  
Design Languages (e.g. Verilog, VHDL).  
  
The candidate should be able to work in a collaborative environment,  
with a strong committment to reaching research excellence and achieving  
assigned objectives.  
  
Early availability will be considered with much favour.  
  
Terms and dates  
===============  
  
The position will start as soon as possible, and will have to be  
renewed yearly, for a maximum of two years. The expected salary  
will range from about 2200 to 2400 euros net income, and the gross  
will include previdential (social security) contributions. Facilities  
for meals at the local canteen can be provided.  
  
Applications and Inquiries  
==========================  
  
Interested candidates should inquire for further information and/or  
apply by sending email to [wolf-recruit@disi.unitn.it](mailto:wolf-
recruit@disi.unitn.it), with subject  
'POSTDOC ON WOLF PROJECT'.  
  
Applications should contain a statement of interest, with a Curriculum  
Vitae, and the names of reference persons. PDF format is strongly  
encouraged. It should also indicate an estimated starting date.

=======================================================================  
  
The Embedded Systems Research Unit at FBK  
=========================================  
  
The Embedded Systems Unit consists of about 15 persons, including  
researchers, post-Doc, Ph.D. students, and programmers. The  
Unit carries out research, tool development and technology transfer in  
the fields of design and verification of embedded systems.  
  
Current research directions include:  
  
* Satisfiability Modulo Theory, and its application to the  
verification of hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid  
systems (Verilog, SystemC, C/C++, StateFlow/Simulink).  
  
* Formal Requirements Analysis based on techniques for temporal logics  
(consistency checking, vacuity detection, input determinism,  
cause-effect analysis, realizability and synthesis).  
  
* Formal Safety Analysis, based on the integration of traditional  
techniques (e.g. Fault-tree analysis, FMEA) with symbolic  
verification techniques.  
  
The Embedded Systems Unit is part of Fondazione Bruno Kessler,  
formerly Istituto Trentino di Cultura, a public research institute of  
the Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy), founded in 1976. The  
institute, through its center for the scientific and technological  
research, is active in the areas of Information Technology,  
Microsystems, and Physical Chemistry of Surfaces and  
Interfaces. Today, FBK is an internationally recognized research  
institute, collaborating with industries, universities, and public and  
private laboratories in Italy and abroad. The institute's applied and  
basic research activities aim at resolving real-world problems, driven  
by the need for technological innovation in society and industry.  
  
The SW Engineering, Formal Methods & Security Research Program at DISI  
======================================================================  
  
The SW Engineering, Formal Methods & Security R. P. at DISI currently  
consists on 5 faculties, various post-docs and PhD students. The  
Unit carries out research, tool development and technology transfer in  
the fields of Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering, Agent-oriented  
SW engineering, Security, and Formal Methods.  
  
Referring to formal methods, current research directions include:  
  
* Satisfiability Modulo Theory, and its application to the  
verification of hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid  
systems.  
  
* Optimization in SMT and its applications.  
  
* Advanced Model Checking Techniques for Formal Verification of  
hardware, embedded critical software, and hybrid systems.  
  
The R.P. is part of the Department of Information Engineering and  
Computer Science, DISI (<http://disi.unitn.it/>) of University of Trento.  
University of Trento in the latest years has always been rated among the  
top-three small&medium-size universities in Italy.  
DISI currently consists of 50 faculties, 68 research staff and support  
people, 21 postdocs and 146 Doctoral students, plus administrative and  
technical staff. DISI covers all the different areas of information  
technology (computer science, telecommunications, and electronics)  
and their applications. These disciplines above are studied  
individually but also with a strong focus on their integration,
