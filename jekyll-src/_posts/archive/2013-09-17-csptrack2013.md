Track on Constraint Solving and Programming  
part of the  
29th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing  
  
Gyeongju, Korea  
  
March 24 - 28, 2014  
  
[http://WWW.DMI.UNIPG.IT/~bista/organizing/constraint-
sac2014/](http://www.dmi.unipg.it/~bista/organizing/constraint-sac2014/)  
  
*************************************************************************  
  
IMPORTANT DATES  
The schedule of important dates for the track is as follows, note that the
submission deadline isstrict:  
• Paper Submission deadline September 21, 2013  
• Author notification November 15, 2013  
• Camera-ready copy deadline December 6, 2013  
  
*************************************************************************  
  
OVERVIEW  
Constraints have emerged as the basis of a representational and computational
paradigm that draws from many disciplines and can be brought to bear on many
problem domains.  
  
*************************************************************************  
  
SCOPE  
The track is concerned with all aspects of computing with constraints
including algorithms, applications, environments, languages, models, and
systems. Contributions are welcome from any discipline concerned with
constraints, including Knowledge representation, artificial intelligence,
combinatorial algorithms, computational logic, concurrent computation,
databases, discrete mathematics, operations research, programming languages,
and symbolic computation. We also solicit papers from any domain employing
constraints, including computational linguistics, configuration, decision
support, design, diagnosis, graphics, hardware verification, molecular
biology, planning, qualitative reasoning, real-time systems, resource
allocation, robotics, scheduling, software engineering, temporal reasoning,
vision, visualization, and user interfaces. Papers that bridge disciplines or
combine theory and practice or discuss novel reasoning methods are especially
welcome. Also special welcome are papers dealing with problem modeling. A
special attention is focused around the use of constraint technologies in the
networking, wireless and internet fields.  
  
*************************************************************************  
  
SUBMISSIONS  
We would like to invite authors to submit papers on research on constraint
solving and programming, with particular emphasis on assessing the current
state of the art and identifying future directions.  
Submissions fall into the following categories:  
• Original and unpublished research work  
• Reports of innovative computing applications in the arts, sciences,
engineering, and business areas  
• Reports of successful technology transfer to new problem domains  
• Reports of industrial experience and demos of new innovative systems  
  
Submission instructions:  
• Submissions should be properly anonymized to facilitate blind reviewing: The
author(s) name(s) and address(es) must NOT appear in the body of the paper,
and self-reference should be in the third person. Only the title should be
shown at the first page without the author's information.  
• Submitted papers must fit within six (6) two column pages: please check the
author kit latex style on the main SAC website:
<http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/sac2014(the> format is usually the format
used in the ACM templates). Papers failing to comply with length limitations
risk immediate rejection.  
• Submissions will be in electronic format, via the
website:<https://www.softconf.com/d/sac2014> BE CAREFULL TO SELECT THE CSP
TRACK BY CHECKING THE CSP-CONSTRAINT TRACK RADIO BUTTON!!  
• After completing the submission, please send also an email to:
[bista@dmi.unipg.it](mailto:bista@dmi.unipg.it)  
The body of the email should include the title of the paper, the author(s)
name(s) and affiliation(s), and the address (including e-mail, telephone, and
fax) to which correspondence should be sent. The subject of the email should
be "SAC2014 constraint track submission"  
  
*************************************************************************  
  
Accepted papers instructions:  
• Accepted, papers must fit within six (6) two column pages, with the option
for up to 2 additional pages at cost (US$80 per page).  
• A second set of selected papers, which did not get accepted as full papers,
will be accepted as posters, limited to 2 pages with the option for up to 1
additional page at cost (US$80).  
• Authors of accepted papers must be prepared to sign a copyright statement
and must pay the registration fee and guarantee that their paper will be
presented at the conference. No-show of scheduled papers will result in
excluding the papers from the ACM/IEEE digital library.
