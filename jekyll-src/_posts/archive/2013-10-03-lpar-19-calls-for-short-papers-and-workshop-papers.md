==============================  
The 19th International Conference on  
Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning  
  
CALL FOR SHORT PAPERS and WORKSHOP PAPERS  
============================================================  
  
Stellenbosch, South Africa, 14-19 December 2013  
[www.LPAR-19.info](http://www.LPAR-19.info)  
  
The series of International Conferences on Logic for Programming, Artificial  
Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is a forum where, year after year, some of  
the most renowned researchers in the areas of logic, automated reasoning,  
computational logic, programming languages and their applications come to  
present cutting-edge results, to discuss advances in these fields, and to  
exchange ideas in a scientifically emerging part of the world. The 19th LPAR  
will be held in Stellenbosch, South Africa.  
  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
* SHORT PAPERS  
  
In keeping with the tradition of LPAR, researchers and practitioners are  
invited to submit short papers reporting on interesting work in progress or  
providing system descriptions. They need not be original. Extended or revised  
versions of the short papers may be submitted concurrently with or after LPAR  
to another conference or a journal. Short papers are limited in length to 8  
pages in the EasyChair format.  
  
Accepted papers will be published electronically as a volume in the EPiC  
series, see <http://www.easychair.org/publications/?page=38379010>. Authors of  
accepted papers are required to ensure that at least one of them will be  
present at the conference. Papers that do not adhere to this policy will not  
be published.  
  
The LaTeX, Microsoft Word and LibreOffice templates for the EPiC series may  
be downloaded from <http://www.easychair.org/publications/?page=1594225690>.  
Short papers must be submitted through the EasyChair system using the web page  
<https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lpar19>  
  
Paper submission deadline: October 14th, 2013
