Call for Papers  
\---------------  
  
IJCAR is the premier international joint conference on all topics  
in automated reasoning. The IJCAR technical program will consist  
of presentations of high-quality original research papers,  
system descriptions, and invited talks.  
  
IJCAR 2014 is a merger of leading events in automated reasoning:  
  
CADE (Conference on Automated Deduction),  
FroCoS (Workshop on Frontiers of Combining Systems) and  
TABLEAUX (Conference on Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods)  
  
IJCAR 2014 invites submissions related to all aspects of automated  
reasoning, including foundations, implementations, and applications.  
Original research papers and descriptions of working automated deduction  
systems are solicited.  
  
IJCAR topics include the following ones:  
  
\- Logics of interest include: propositional, first-order, classical,  
equational, higher-order, non-classical, constructive, modal,  
temporal, many-valued, substructural, description, type theory, etc.  
  
\- Methods of interest include: tableaux, sequent calculi, resolution,  
model-elimination, inverse method, paramodulation, term rewriting,  
induction, unification, constraint solving, decision procedures,  
model generation, model checking, semantic guidance, interactive  
theorem proving, logical frameworks, AI-related methods for  
deductive systems, proof presentation, automated theorem provers,  
etc.  
  
\- Applications of interest include: verification, formal methods,  
program analysis and synthesis, computer mathematics, declarative  
programming, deductive databases, knowledge representation, etc.  
  
The proceedings of IJCAR 2014 will be published by Springer-Verlag in  
the LNAI/LNCS series.
