Kaggle has kicked off its annual winter optimization challenge
(<https://www.kaggle.com/c/helping-santas-helpers>): an unusual and difficult
job shop scheduling problem that has to be solved.  
  
Researchers, professionals and students are invited to participate and have a
go at the prize money. You are free to use the tools of your choice and there
is a special prize for submissions (<https://www.kaggle.com/c/helping-santas-
helpers/details/compete-with-fico-xpress>) using FICO Xpress; see
<https://community.fico.com/community/products-%26-solutions-
support/xpressdiscuss> for more information.  
  
Kaggle is known mainly for hosting analytics competitions. This is an
opportunity for OR practitioners to compete with data scientists on a large-
scale problem.  
  
Good luck!
