About Inria  


Established in 1967, Inria is the only public research body fully dedicated to
computational sciences.  
Combining computer sciences with mathematics, Inria’s 3,500 researchers strive
to invent the digital technologies of the future. Educated at leading
international universities, they creatively integrate basic research with
applied research and dedicate themselves to solving real problems,
collaborating with the main players in public and private research in France
and abroad and transferring the fruits of their work to innovative companies.  
The researchers at Inria published over 4,500 articles in 2013. They are
behind over 300 active patents and 120 start-ups. The 172 project teams are
distributed in eight research centers located throughout France.  
  

  
  
Topic  


 **Context**  
Modern societies crucially rely on digital infrastructures, and it is becoming
clear that high-quality software can be obtained only with the help of proper
software verification tools. Today most major verification approaches rely on
automatic external solvers. Beyond verification, solvers are also widely
employed in numerous application domains for performing complex reasoning
tasks. These solvers, however, do not fill the current and future needs for
verification: lack of satisfying model generation, lack of reasoning on
difficult theories, lack of extensibility for specific or new needs.  
**Objectives**  
The work will be performed in the context of SOPRANO [1], a research project
involving experts from academia and industry that are developing state-of-the-
art constraint solving technology. The major results of the project include
scientific, technological, and industrial benefits. The project has the
potential to deliver significant breakthroughs in automated constraint solving
and program analysis [2, 3]. The PhD thesis aims to prepare the next
generation of solvers, thus opening avenues for novel verifications and
reasoning. The resulting solvers will be more widely applicable, easier to
tune for specific applications, and potentially more efficient. The PhD
candidate will design a new framework for the cooperation/combination of
solvers, focused on model generation and borrowing principles from
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT-solving) [4, 5, 8, 9] and Constraint
Programming (CP) [6, 7]. Roughly speaking, we seek to add to SMT the
extensibility of CP and its native handling of domains, and to CP the elegant
communication interfaces of SMT and its ability to reason over formulas with
complex boolean structures (conflict analysis) and quantifiers.

Security and defence procedure  


In the interests of protecting its scientific and technological assets, Inria
is a restricted-access establishment. Consequently, it follows special
regulations for welcoming any person who whishes to work with the institute.
The final acceptance of each candidate thus depends on applying this security
and defence procedure.
