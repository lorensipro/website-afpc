ACAI’15 Summer School on Constraints Solving Techniques in AI  
  
ACAI’15@CRIL  
Constraints Solving Techniques in AI  
26th-30th October  
Lille, France  
  
<http://www.cril.fr/acai15/>  
  
In odd-numbered years, the European Coordinating Committee for  
Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI) sponsors a specialised course in  
Artificial Intelligence, called Advanced Course on Artificial  
Inteliigence (ACAI).  
  
The ACAI Summer School 2015 will be held at Lille, France, from the  
26th October to the 30th October 2015 and its topic will be  
Constraints Solving Techniques in Artificial Intelligence. It will be  
organized by CRIL (Centre de Recherche en Informatique de Lens -  
[http://www.cril.fr](http://www.cril.fr/)).  
  
Constraint Solving Techniques offer a number of notions, languages and  
solvers for building reasoning and decision making tools, which are at  
the core of a wide spectrum of AI applications. Much progress has been  
made for decades, and new paradigms have emerged within this area.  
While the various Constraint Solving Techniques have some common  
origins, they have evolved independently and each of them has  
developed its own specificities. This is why it is important to give  
to our doctoral students and young colleagues a broad, yet coherent  
view of such techniques and it is the main goal of the ACAI’15@CRIL  
Summer School to do so.  
  
Accordingly, the school will address several Constraint Solving  
Techniques, including SAT, CSP, ASP, and Knowledge compilation. Both  
the fundamental issues and the key concepts will be presented, as well  
as some of the more recent developments.  
  
The school will consist of 4 Fundamental Courses (3 x 1h30):  
* SAT (by Ines Lynce)  
* CSP (by Ian Gent)  
* ASP (by Torsten Schaub)  
* Knowledge Compilation (by Pierre Marquis)  
And of 5 Advanced Courses (1x 1h30):  
* SMT (by Albert Oliveras)  
* SAT for Data Mining (by Lakhdar Saïs)  
* WCSP (by Martin Cooper)  
* XCSP (by Christophe Lecoutre)  
* Evaluation & Competitions of Solvers (by Daniel Le Berre and  
Olivier Roussel)  
  
The organization of ACAI’15@CRIL made its best to ensure the lowest  
possible costs, in order to promote the participation of the largest  
number of researchers:  
* Registration fees will be 125 euros (until 31th July).  
* Some cheap accommodation (around 135 euros for the week) will be  
possible.  
  
Note also that ECCAi will provide a number of grants for students,  
details about the application procedure will be available soon on the  
ACAI webpage.  
  
Lille is easily reachable from all over Europe, since it is close to  
three capitals (1h by train from Paris and from  
Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle airport, 30mn from Brussels, and 1h30 from  
London).  
  
Important Dates :  
Early Registration : 31th July 2015
