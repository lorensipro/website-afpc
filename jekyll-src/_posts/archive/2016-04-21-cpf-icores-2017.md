ICORES is sponsored by [INSTICC](http://www.insticc.org/) – Institute for
Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communication





## SCOPE



The purpose of the International Conference on Operations Research and
Enterprise Systems (ICORES) is to bring together researchers, engineers and
practitioners interested in both advances and applications in the field of
operations research. Two simultaneous tracks will be held, covering on one
side domain independent methodologies and technologies and on the other side
practical work developed in specific application areas.  
  
ICORES focuses on real world applications; therefore authors should highlight
the benefits of Operations Research Methodologies and Technologies for
industry and services, either in general or for particular applications. Ideas
on how to solve business problems, using operations research methodologies and
technologies, will arise from the conference. Papers describing advanced
prototypes, systems, case studies, tools and techniques and general survey
papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing
original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers,
presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the
Proceedings of ICORES. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and
originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are
welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions.  
  
Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as
well as tutorials dedicated to technical/scientific topics are also envisaged:
companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers
interested in holding a tutorial are invited to contact the conference
secretariat.







## CONFERENCE AREAS



Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not
exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although
authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are

## PAPER SUBMISSION





Authors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct
grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or
topics. Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its
technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains or environments
to which it is applicable. To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation
method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT
any reference to any of the authors, including the authors’ personal details,
the acknowledgments section of the paper and any other reference that may
disclose the authors’ identity.  
  
Only original papers should be submitted. Authors are advised to read
[INSTICC's ethical norms regarding plagiarism and self-
plagiarism](http://icores.org/NormsPlagiarism.aspx)thoroughly before
submitting and must make sure that their submissions do not substantially
overlap work which has been published elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to
a journal or another conference with proceedings. Papers that contain any form
of plagiarism will be rejected without reviews.  
  
Authors can submit their work in the form of a Regular Paper, representing
completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short
report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing
ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific
research focused on one of the conference topic areas. All papers must be
submitted through the online submission platform
[PRIMORIS](http://www.insticc.org/primoris) and should follow the instructions
and templates that can be found under [Guidelines and
Templates](http://icores.org/GuidelinesTemplates.aspx). After the paper
submission has been successfully completed, authors will receive an automatic
confirmation e-mail.  
  









## PUBLICATIONS



All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an
ISBN reference, on paper and on CD-ROM support.  
SCITEPRESS is a member of CrossRef (<http://www.crossref.org/>) and every
paper is given a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).  
All papers presented at the conference venue will be available at the
[SCITEPRESS Digital
Library](http://www.scitepress.org/DigitalLibrary/Default.aspx).  
The proceedings will be submitted for indexation by Thomson Reuters Conference
Proceedings Citation Index (ISI), INSPEC, DBLP, EI (Elsevier Engineering
Village Index) and Scopus.
