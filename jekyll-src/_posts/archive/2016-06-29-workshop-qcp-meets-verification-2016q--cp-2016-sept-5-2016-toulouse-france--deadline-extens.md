       ==  CALL FOR ABSTRACTS ==Third Workshop "CP meets Verification 2016"Co-located event of CP 2016 (<http://cp2016.a4cp.org/>)Toulouse, France - September 5th 2016Website: <http://cp2016.a4cp.org/program/workshops/ws-cpcav16.html>== IMPORTANT DATES ==Submission:   June 4, 2016( ***deadline extension*** )Notification: July 15, 2016Workshop: September 5, 2016== THEMES AND OBJECTIVES ==*Constraint programming* (CP) is a programming paradigm for themodelling and solving of constrained problems, such as complex problemsin resource allocation, scheduling, configuration, and design. Thesuccess of CP comes from the fact that it provides high-level languagesfor declaratively modelling a problem by means of constraints thatcapture combinatorial substructures (and by means of an objectivefunction) and for writing an efficient search procedure that solves theproblem. *Computer-aided program verification* has found widespreadapplications in both academia and industry in ensuring that systems aredependable and secure. The discipline is based on fundamentalmathematical theories such as logic and automata, and covers algorithmictechniques for formal analysis and synthesis, such as model checking,satisfiability (SAT) solving, and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT).These techniques have become essential tools for the design and analysisof hardware and software systems.The "CP meets Verification" workshop gathers researchers andpractitioners from constraint programming (CP), formal verification, andsoftware engineering, in order to address the *CP-based solving* ofchallenging constraint problems in *formal verification* and *softwareengineering* and foster novel ideas between CP and formal verification,since solvers of CP technology are orthogonal but complementary tosolvers of technologies like SAT, SAT modulo theories (SMT), integerprogramming (IP), and mixed integer programming (MIP).As the workshop aims at fostering lively discussions and debates betweenparticipants, it will be organized around- several invited talks given by experts of the corresponding domains,- accepted talks based on a lightweight reviewing of submitted abstracts,- space for questions and discussions.The CP meets Verification 2016 workshop invites all interestedparticipants to *submit an abstract* of a talk to be presented duringthe workshop. Talks may present both original or already published work,tool developments as well as work in progress. Talks with emphasis onnovel ideas or challenges are particularly welcome! Abstracts of at mostone page, in text or PDF form, should be submitted by Email by thedeadline given below. The talks most compliant with the workshop themeand objectives will be selected for presentation in a full-day workshop.For all inquiries, please contact the organizers.The workshop will not require paper submission and will not publishproceedings, but the presenters will be invited to submit the slides oftheir talks for publication on the workshop website.All researchers and practitioners interested in the scope of theworkshop, whether presenters or not, are invited to attend the workshopand to participate in discussions.Inquiries and submission of abstracts by Email: [cpmeetsverif16@cea.fr](mailto:cpmeetsverif16@cea.fr)== Workshop Chairs ==- Sébastien Bardin (CEA LIST, France)- François Bobot (CEA LIST, France)- Nikolai Kosmatov (CEA LIST, France)Contact: [cpmeetsverif16@cea.fr](mailto:cpmeetsverif16@cea.fr)== List of topics (not limited to) ==- CP-based verification- CP-based software engineering- challenges in formal verification where CP can be helpful- synergies between CP and verification technologies (model checking,abstract interpretation, etc.)- synergies between CP, SAT, SMT, IP and/or MIP
