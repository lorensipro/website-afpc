The TCS Group at KTH Royal Institute of Technology invites applications for a
PhD position in CS focusing on algorithms for solving the Boolean
satisfiability problem (SAT) very efficiently for large classes of instances,
and on analyzing and understanding such algorithms. To receive full
consideration your application should be submitted via
<http://www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/openings/J-2018-2101-Eng.php> by the deadline
October 31, 2018, but candidates will be reviewed continuously and early
applications are strongly encouraged.





This is a position within the Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous
Systems and Software Program WASP (<http://wasp-sweden.org/>), Sweden's
largest ever individual research program and a major national initiative for
strategically motivated basic research, education and faculty recruitment. The
PhD student will be part of the WASP AI-Math Graduate School, providing a
valuable network with other researchers within WASP and presenting unique
opportunities for students who are dedicated to achieving international
research excellence with industrial relevance.





This is a four-year full-time employed position, but PhD positions usually
(though not necessarily) include 20% teaching, in which case they are
prolonged for one more year. The successful candidate would ideally start
sometime as early as possible in 2019, though this is negotiable. The position
is fully funded and comes with a competitive salary.





See <http://www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/openings/J-2018-2101-Eng.php> for the full
announcement with more information and instructions how to apply. Informal
enquiries are welcome and may be sent to [jakobn@kth.se](mailto:jakobn@kth.se)
